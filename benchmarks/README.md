## ðŸ“„ Schema Description: `UPC_Sentinel_Verification_Result.csv`

For each benchmark obtained, the file `UPC Sentinel Verification Result.csv` provides contract-level validation results generated by **UPC Sentinel (V2)**. It compares UPC Sentinelâ€™s predictions with the original ground truth labels and includes detailed metadata related to each contractâ€™s upgradeability characteristics.

This schema is designed to support **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **explainability** in upgradeability proxy contract (UPC) detection at scale.

### ðŸ“Š Table Columns

| **Column Name**                                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `address`                                        | The Ethereum address of the analyzed smart contract.                           |
| `groundtruth-is-upc`                             | Indicates whether the contract is labeled as a UPC in the original dataset.    |
| `upcsentinel-is-upc`                             | Indicates whether UPC Sentinel classified the contract as a UPC.               |
| `upcsentinel-is-proxy-static-analysis`           | Indicates whether UPC Sentinel identified the contract as a proxy via static (bytecode) analysis. |
| `upcsentinel-is-proxy-dynamic-analysis`          | Indicates whether UPC Sentinel identified the contract as a proxy via dynamic (transactional) analysis. |
| `upcsentinel-is-proxy`                           | True if the contract is identified as a proxy by any method (static or dynamic). |
| `upcsentinel-logic-contract-count`               | Number of logic (implementation) contracts associated with the proxy, as of 2025/04/01. |
| `upcsentinel-logic-contract-addr`                | Comma-separated list of detected logic contract addresses.                     |
| `upcsentinel-proxy-funcs-start-loc`              | Decompiled bytecode line of code where proxy functions (i.e., the function where proxy is implemented) start. Multiple entries may appear if the proxy logic is not confined to a fallback function. |
| `upcsentinel-upc-reference-design`               | The reference upgradeability proxy design pattern detected â€” either `SMUP`, `DUP`, or `ESUP`. |
| `upcsentinel-upgrade-funcs-contract-path`        | The chain of contracts where upgrade functions were detected. This shows the hierarchical path (e.g., `Proxy -> Impl -> Impl2`) ending with the contract where the upgrade function capable of modifying the implementation address is implemented. |
| `upcsentinel-upgrade-funcs-(sig,loc-range)`      | List of function signatures and their corresponding decompiled bytecode location ranges for all detected upgrade functions. |
